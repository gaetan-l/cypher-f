I worked previously as an analyst/developer for 6 years before switching careers, so I hadn't programmed in three years when I started this project. I wanted to see if I was still able to do it and test my expertise. I also took the chance to experiment with languages I had never worked with, namely Javascript and PHP. Last but not least, I wanted to address some issues that had been bothering me for a while: my strong inclination to procrastinate, and my inability to finish a task I started. Let this project be the proof that I can change for the better.",
